## Managing and Sustaining Codespaces
#### Gitpod Workspace Pinning

**Purpose:** Workspace pinning prevents important workspaces from being
automatically deleted.

**Pinned Workspace:** A workspace that has been pinned will never be deleted,
regardless of inactivity or other automated processes.


- Navigate to your workspace list in the Gitpod dashboard.
- Identify the workspace you want to keep permanently.
- Pin the workspace to ensure it remains available and is not subject to
deletion.  ![manage gitpod workspace](../../assets/manage_workspace.png)

**Benefits:**

Protects critical projects or environments from accidental loss.  Ensures
long-term availability of specific workspaces that you frequently use or need to
preserve.
