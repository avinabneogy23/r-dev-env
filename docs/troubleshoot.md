1. **Retry After Some Time**
Wait for a few minutes and try running the `rsync` command
again. The number of active connections may decrease,
allowing you to connect.

Sometimes, simply restarting your Codespace can resolve
temporary connection issues. Try restarting your
Codespace and then attempt the `rsync` command again.
